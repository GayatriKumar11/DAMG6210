## Business Problems Addressed

- Automotive distributors currently rely on a manual inventory tracking process that is error-prone, leading to issues such as overstocking or stockouts. These inefficiencies directly impact our ability to fulfill customer orders promptly and efficiently manage inventory costs, hindering our overall operational effectiveness.
- Within our automotive distribution operations, the existing order management system is characterized by fragmentation, with different departments utilizing disparate tools and methodologies. This fragmented approach contributes to delays, errors, and inefficiencies in the processing and fulfillment of orders, which adversely affects our customer service and operational efficiency.
- In the automotive distribution sector, the absence of real-time reporting and analytics tools poses significant challenges for our management team in making informed decisions. To address this, we require a comprehensive reporting system that provides us with the capability to analyze inventory data in real-time, track performance, and ultimately make data-driven decisions to improve our operations.
- As our automotive distribution organization continues to expand and forge new partnerships, our existing systems struggle to cope with the increasing volume and complexity of data. To meet the evolving demands of our business, we must implement a scalable solution capable of accommodating this growth without compromising efficiency.
- Given the sensitive nature of inventory data in the automotive distribution sector, unauthorized access to this information can have severe consequences, including data breaches, the loss of intellectual property, and various security risks. To mitigate these risks, we must establish robust access control mechanisms that safeguard our data and ensure compliance with industry-specific security standards.
- In the automotive distribution industry, data loss and system downtime can have a profound impact on our business operations. To address this, it is imperative that we implement a robust data backup and recovery strategy. Such a strategy will not only help us maintain data integrity but also minimize disruptions, ensuring the continued smooth operation of our business even in the face of unforeseen challenges.

## Business Rules

- A car brand may produce a car model only if they have an active supply agreement with the required parts
- Parts are sold in batches to car brands, with batch sizes determined by the supplier's packaging specifications and the brand's ordering preferences.
- Each car brand has one or more assembly units where the parts are sourced to and the final product is made. This unit may or may not located at the car brand office address.
- Parts for a car model are not available for purchase once the car brand has officially discontinued production for that model.
- Parts can be transported between suppliers, manufacturers, and assembly units using approved transportation methods and carriers, with specified delivery timeframes and tracking requirements.
- Car types, such as sedans, SUVs, and electric vehicles, are categorized based on their specifications and features, with each type subject to distinct manufacturing, distribution, and marketing strategies.
- Electric car models must comply with regulatory standards for battery safety, charging infrastructure compatibility, and emissions reduction initiatives in the regions where they are distributed for assembly.
