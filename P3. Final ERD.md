# P3. Final ERD

## Changes made to the initial ERD

Feedback from the professor:

> Can you remove redundancy to Part so you donâ€™t repeat it for different cars? What does Sales_Id_To and By refer to? There is no relationship link shown. Same with Purchase. What is the difference between Purchase and Sales? What is PurchaseRow and SalesRow? The ERD needs to be streamlined and simplified to reflect the entities and relationships of your business rules.

Based on the above feedback, we have incorporated the following changes in the ERD:

- Remove car relation from Part to avoid duplicating parts for each car, replace with Blueprint to maintain many-to-many relations
- Combine Purchase and Sales into a single Transaction model
- Remove separate PurchaseRow/SalesRow and replace with TransactionRow
